## About
[pythonbasedball](https://github.com/Vortigern-The-Grey/pythonbasedball) is an opinionated baseball simulator originally developed by [carrsjn](https://github.com/carrsjn) and tweaked/polished by [Vortigern](https://github.com/Vortigern-The-Grey). It is the engine which powers Basedball.

Basedball is something else, an internet baseball league inspired by [Blaseball](https://blaseball.com) but way less cool.
