pythonbasedball is an opinionated baseball simulator originally developed by [carrsjn](github.com/carrsjn) and tweaked and polished by [Vortigern](github.com/Vortigern-The-Grey). It is the engine which powers Basedball.

Basedball is something else, an internet baseball league inspired by [Blaseball](blaseball.com) but way less cool.
