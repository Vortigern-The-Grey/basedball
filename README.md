[pythonbasedball](https://github.com/Vortigern-The-Grey/pythonbasedball) is an opinionated baseball simulator originally developed by [carrsjn](https://github.com/carrsjn) and tweaked/polished by [Vortigern](https://github.com/Vortigern-The-Grey). It is the engine which powers Basedball/ILB-Based.

Basedball is something else, a small Internet League Baseball fantasy baseball project inspired by [Blaseball](https://blaseball.com) but way less cool. Also known as ILB-Based, or by the project name, based-af.

I use NVChad btw.

## Schedule
The current schedule and timeframe of IBL-Based are TBD, but the structure is likely to involve multiple seasons and a sizeable number of teams.

## Teams/Statistics
The current teams are the Baltimore Crabs, the Houston Giants, the South Dakota Sunbeams and the Chicago Firefighters. Suggestions for new teams can be submitted as issues in the repo.
 A table of the teams and their relevant statistics can be found at the [Stats](/stats.md) page.
