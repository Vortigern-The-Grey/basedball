[pythonbasedball](https://github.com/Vortigern-The-Grey/pythonbasedball) is an opinionated baseball simulator originally developed by [carrsjn](https://github.com/carrsjn) and tweaked/polished by [Vortigern](https://github.com/Vortigern-The-Grey). It is the engine which powers Basedball/ILB-Based.

Basedball is something else, a small Internet League Baseball fantasy baseball project inspired by [Blaseball](https://blaseball.com) but way less cool. Also known as ILB-Based, or by the project name, based-af.

## Schedule
The current schedule and timeframe of IBL-Based are TBD, but the structure is likely to involve multiple seasons and a sizeable number of teams.
